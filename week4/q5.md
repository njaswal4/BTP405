1st Part: 

Approach 1: 

The doubleL function takes an integer n and returns a list with elements obtained by doubling each integer from 0 to n-1. The code then uses a for loop to iterate over the elements produced by doubleL(5), printing each doubled element followed by ' : '

Approach 2:

The code uses list comprehension to create a list of doubled integers from 0 to 4. A for loop then iterates through this list, printing each element followed by ' : '.

Approach 3:

The doubleG generator function yields elements that result from doubling each integer from 0 to n-1. A for loop is used to iterate over the elements yielded by doubleG(5), printing each element followed by ' : '.


2nd part : 

doubleG(n) is a Generator Function that  uses the yield keyword to produce a sequence of values one at a time. The yield statement suspends the functionâ€™s state, allowing it to resume from where it left off when the next value is requested.

Advantages: 

These functions  are efficient due to their ability to produce values one at a time, avoiding the storage of the entire sequence in memory. This memory efficiency is particularly advantageous for large data. Additionally, generators use lazy evaluation, computing values  only when requested, saving computation time especially when not all values are needed simultaneously.
